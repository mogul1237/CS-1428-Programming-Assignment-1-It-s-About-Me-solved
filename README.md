Problem:
Write a C++ program that will output information about you to the computer screen.
The output should look like this (there must be a blank line between each item.):
Name:
Major:
Favorite Movie: Replace the stuff in the angle brackets with your own information. Here’s an example:
Name: Jill Seaman
Major: Computer Science
Favorite Movie: “The Princess Bride” 1987
Note: It’s ok if the title is long and it wraps onto the next line.
Style:
See the Style Guidelines document on the course website (cs.txstate.edu/~js236/
cs1428). Especially pay attention to the comments required for the top of the file:
// File Name:
//
// Author:
// Date:
// Assignment Number:
//
// Additional Requirements:
• Grading Threshold: Your program must compile and run, otherwise you will
receive a score of 0!!
• You must use an IDE like CodeBlocks or Xcode to write and execute your program!
If you use an editor (like notepad) or a word processor, your file most likely will not
compile and run when we test it!!
• You may work together but you must submit your own program, which outputs your
own information.
Logistics:
Name your file assign1_xxxxx.cpp where xxxxx is your TX State NetID (your
txstate.edu email id). The file name should look something like this: assign1_js236.cpp
There are two steps to the turn-in process:
1. Submit an electronic copy using the Assignments tool on the TRACS website for
this class (tracs.txstate.edu). Submit the .cpp file, (NOT a .cbp file!).
2. Submit a printout of the .cpp file at the beginning of class on the day the
assignment is due. Please print your name on the front page.
See the assignment turn-in policy on the course website (cs.txstate.edu/~js236/cs1428)
for more details.
